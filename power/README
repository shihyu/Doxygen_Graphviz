The following is what I have done.

Install Doxygen and Graphviz. In my case, I only had to install Graphviz (and I am using linux fedora)
sudo yum install graphviz
Go to the folder where your source files are located.
doxygen -g
This will generate a configuration file, named ‘Doxyfile’.
Modify Doxyfile if necessary. To generate a callgraph, you need to set up appropriately. I changed the following properties. 
HAVE_DOT               = YES
EXTRACT_ALL            = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES
CALL_GRAPH             = YES
Then you run doxygen:
doxygen Doxyfile
New folder ‘html’ and ‘latex’ will be generated, and you can find all the documentations in the folders.
